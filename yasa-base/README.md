#yasa
##The compiler

This is the directory for the central yasa compliler.

The compliter source has three parts: hash, IO, and yasa.

*Hash serves to convert from the three letter commands to more useable integers.

*IO might actually be better named just I. It controls reading from ether a file or the command line.

*yasa is where the meat of the interpreter is. It contains the central switch statemnet, along with a variety of state variables and the  main function.
