#yasa

yasa is Yet Another Scripting Attrocity. It's main feature is that it takes the stangeness of assembly language, and combines it with the slowness of an interpreted language. Its the worst of both worlds, but I like it all the same.

This package contains
 * The yasa interpreter, [yasa](https://github.com/JacksonKearl/yasa/yasa-base)
 * A brainfuck to yassa translator, fuck-yasa [yasa](https://github.com/JacksonKearl/yasa/fuck-yasa)
 * A befunge to yasa translator, be-yasa [yasa](https://github.com/JacksonKearl/yasa/be-yasa)
