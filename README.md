#yasa

yasa is **_Yet Another Scripting Attrocity_**. Its main feature is that it takes the stangeness of assembly language, and combines it with the slowness of an interpreted language. Its the worst of both worlds, but I like it all the same.

This package contains:

* The yasa interpreter, [yasa](https://github.com/JacksonKearl/yasa/tree/master/yasa-base)

* A brainfuck to yassa translator, [fuck-yasa](https://github.com/JacksonKearl/yasa/tree/master/fuck-yasa)

* A befunge to yasa translator, [be-yasa](https://github.com/JacksonKearl/yasa/tree/master/be-yasa)

 More information about each of these submodules can be found in their respective directories.
